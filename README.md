# TicTacToe Game 

## Description
TicTacToe Game is a simple console-based tic-tac-toe game written in Java. Players can play on a 3x3 board.

## Project Contents
The project consists of two main classes:

Board: This class represents the game board. It is responsible for drawing the board, setting player signs on the board, checking if a cell is free, and determining if a player has won or if there is a draw.

Game: This class handles the game logic. It is responsible for conducting the game, reading player moves from the console, and communicating with the players.

## Running Instructions
1. Compile the project using a Java compiler.
2. Run the Game class in your Java environment.

## Playing Instructions
The game starts by displaying the board in the console.
Players take turns entering their moves by inputting the column number and row number where they want to place their mark (e.g., "1,1" for the first column and first row).
The game checks the validity of the move, whether the cell is free, and whether the entered coordinates are correct.
The game ends when one player wins or when the board is filled (resulting in a draw).
